        <p>Mechatronics is a multi-disciplinary study dealing with the integration of mechanical devices, actuators,
            sensors, electronics, intelligent controllers and computers. Many new generations of consumer or 
            commercial products can be classified as mechatronic products as they involve mechanical as well as 
            electronic components. The need for mechatronic education has grown due to the increase in the 
            number and importance of such systems and devices. The program is designed to provide in-depth 
            knowledge in the fundamentals, design, analysis and operation of mechatronic systems. The courses will 
            be conducted by faculty from both the Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering Departments. 
            Moreover, specialists from overseas and technical staff from industries will be frequently invited to 
            lecture some of the modules. </p>
